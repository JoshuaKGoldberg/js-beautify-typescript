 JS Beautifier
---------------


  Written by Einar Lielmanis, <einar@jsbeautifier.org>

  Originally converted to javascript by Vital, <vital76@gmail.com>
  "End braces on own line" added by Chris J. Shull, <chrisjshull@gmail.com>
  Parsing improvements for brace-less statements by Liam Newman <bitwiseman@gmail.com>


  Usage:
    js_beautify(js_source_text);
    js_beautify(js_source_text, options);

  The options are:
    indent_size (default 4)          - indentation size,
    indent_char (default space)      - character to indent with,
    preserve_newlines (default true) - whether existing line breaks should be preserved,
    max_preserve_newlines (default unlimited) - maximum number of line breaks to be preserved in one chunk,

    jslint_happy (default false) - if true, then jslint-stricter mode is enforced.

            jslint_happy       !jslint_happy
            ---------------------------------
            function ()        function ()

    brace_style (default "collapse") - "collapse" | "expand" | "end-expand"
            put braces on the same line as control statements (default), or put braces on own line (Allman / ANSI style), or just put end braces on own line.

    space_before_conditional (default true) - should the space before conditional statement be added, "if (true)" vs "if (true)",

    unescape_strings (default false) - should printable characters in strings encoded in \xNN notation be unescaped, "example" vs "\x65\x78\x61\x6d\x70\x6c\x65"

    wrap_line_length (default unlimited) - lines should wrap at next opportunity after this number of characters.
          NOTE: This is not a hard limit. Lines will continue until a point where a newline would
                be preserved if it were present.

    e.g

    js_beautify(js_source_text, {
      'indent_size': 1,
      'indent_char': '\t'
    });
